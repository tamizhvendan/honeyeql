### Logical Operators In Filters

HoneyEQL filter conditions just got better. Now we can use logical operators `and`, `or` & `not` in the `:where` parameter. 

Here are some examples,

```clojure
[{([] {:where [:and 
                [:= :payment/customer-id 1] 
                [:> :payment/amount 5.99M]]}) 
  [:payment/payment-id :payment/amount]}]  
```

```clojure
[{([] {:where [:or 
                [:= :language/name "English"] 
                [:= :language/name "French"]]}) 
  [:language/id :language/name]}]  
```

```clojure
[{([] {:where [:not 
                [:or 
                  [:= :language/name "English"] 
                  [:= :language/name "French"]]]}) 
  [:language/language-id :language/name]}]
```

### Filter Based On Relationship Attributes

The next major update is filtering based on the attributes of a relationship. 

The only difference in the syntax is, in the place of the attribute ident, we will be using a vector of two attribute idents. The first ident is the relationship attribute and then second one is the attribute of the related entity similar to `get-in` function. 

For example, to get all the cities of a county using the country' name,

![](https://www.graphqlize.org/img/address_city_country_er_diagram.png)

we can use the following query.

```clojure
; filtering by one-to-one relationship attribute
[{([] {:where [:= [:city/country :country/country] "Algeria"]}) 
  [:city/city-id :city/city]}]
```

If the relationship attribute is refers a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship, the filter condition yield the results if **any** of the related entities satisfy the condition.

For the above schema, we can get a list of countries which has at-least one city that starts with `Ab`.

```clojure
; filtering by one-to-many relationship attribute
[{([] {:where [:like [:country/cities :city/city] "Ab%"]}) 
 [:country/country-id :country/country]}]
```

For many-to-many relationships also, the query looks similar.

![](https://www.graphqlize.org/img/film_actor_er_diagram.png)


For the above schema, to get the actors who are part of at-lease one film which has the word `LIFE` in its title.

```clojure
; filtering by many-to-many relationship attribute
[{([] {:where [:like [:actor/films :film/title] "%LIFE%"] }) 
 [:actor/first-name :actor/last-name]}]
```

If we want to retrieve only certain entities only if **all** of its related entities satisfy the condition, then we need to used the `:not` and the reverse of the filter condition together.

Let's assume that we have a schema like below 

![](https://www.graphqlize.org/img/author_course_er_diagram.png)

To filter authors who has **at-least** one course with the rating `5`, we can achieve it using the following query.

```clojure
[{([] {:where [:= [:author/courses :course/rating] 5]}) 
  [:author/first-name :author/last-name]}]
```

If we want to filter only the authors who has got the rating `5` in **all** their courses, we can achieve it by

```clojure
[{([] {:where [:not [:<> [:author/courses :course/rating] 5]]}) 
  [:author/first-name :author/last-name]}]
```
